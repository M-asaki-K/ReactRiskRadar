Glycerol and chlorine can react explosively at slightly elevated temperatures (Statesir, W.A. 1973. Chemical Engineering Progress 69(4):54.).    BrF3 ignites or explodes on contact with most organic compounds, including alcohols (Mellor, J.W. 1941. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, p. 113. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.; 1956, Volume 2, Supplemental 1. pp. 164-167).     Ethanol ignites on contact with IF7 (Booth, H.S. et al. 1947. Chemical Reviews 41:428).     Glycerol and PI3 react violently (Leleu, J., 1974, Les Reactions Chimique Dangereuse, Cahiers de Notes Documentaires, (75), 273).     Ethanol reacts vigorously with UF6 (The Chemical Elements and their Compounds, Sidgwick, N.V., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1950, pp. 1072).    Ethanol is oxidized to low-boiling and poisonous acetaldehyde by chlorine and bromine in the presence of strong bases. The acetaldehyde reacts further under these conditions to generate trihaloacetaldehyde, which itself can react further to generate formate and a haloform. This series of reactions is called the haloform reaction (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 305).    Alcohols likely react with acetyl halides to produce HX gases, including HF and HI not listed above (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions).    Alcohols likely react with PX3 compounds forming toxic HX gases, including HF and HI not listed above (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions). Ethers WITH Oxidizing Agents, Strong:    Diethyl ether evolves a gas with nitrosyl perchlorate, then explodes (Hoffman, K.A. et al. 1909. Berichte. 42:2031).    Diethyl ether explodes on contact with fluorine nitrate (Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, Brauer, G., (Translation Ed. Riley, R.F.), London, Academic Press, Vol. 1, 1963. pp. 189).    Diethyl ether explodes on contact with sodium peroxide (Fire and Explosion Risks, von Schwartz, E., London, Griffin, 1918, p. 328).    Diethyl ether explodes on contact with trithioazyl perchlorate (Ergebnisse und Probleme der Chemie der Schwefelstickstoff-verbindung, Scientia Chemica, Vol. 9, Goehring, M., Berlin, Akademie Verlag, 1957, pp. 74).    Mixtures of diethyl ether and I2O7 can explosively decompose (Mishra, H.C. et al. 1962. Journal of the Chemical Society pp. 1195-1196).    CrO3 and ethers, including diethyl ether, methyldioxane, and dimethyldioxane, ignite on contact (Fawcett, H.H. 1959. Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 51(4):90A; Mikhailov, V. 1960. Chemical Abstracts 54:23331f; Mellor, J.W. 1943. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 11, p. 235. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).    Diethyl ether also ignites on contact with chromyl chloride (Mellor, J.W. 1943. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 11, p. 396. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.), or with chlorine if light is present (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1298).    Diethyl ether forms an impact and friction-sensitive mixture with liquid air (Danckwort, P.W. 1927. Angew Chem. 40:1317) or silver perchlorate (Heim, F. 1957. Agnew Chem. 69:274).    Diethyl ether forms an explosive salt with uranyl nitrate (Muller, A. 1916. Chem. Ztg. 40:38; Muller, A. 1917. Chem. Ztg. 41:439), and forms explosive peroxides with H2O2 (Bruhl, J.W. 1895. Berichte. 28:2856-2857).    THF forms explosive products with KO2 (Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1992. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 8th Edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. pp. 3227).    Tetrahydrofuran (reaction may be light-promoted) (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 114) and diethyl ether react violently with bromine (Urben 110); if the bromine is impure, diethyl ether may ignite (University Safety Association. 1989. Safety Digest 34:14).    Diethyl ether reacts vigorously with CrO3, Ca(OCl)2, or ClNO2 (Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1992. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 8th Edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. pp. 1614); and dioxane reacts violently with silver perchlorate (Lewis 1449).    Ethers may release toxic chlorine dioxide gas upon treatment with nitrosyl perchlorate (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions). Ethers WITH Halogenating Agents:    Diethyl ether explodes or ignites on contact with BrF3 (Sharpe, A.G. et al. 1948. Journal of the Chemical Society 2136), BrF5 (Mellor, J.W. 1956. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd. Volume 2, Supplemental 1. pp. 172), or ClF3 (Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1992. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 8th Edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. pp. 1614).    Tetrahydrofuran (reaction may be light-promoted) (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 114) and diethyl ether react violently with bromine (Urben 110); if the bromine is impure, diethyl ether may ignite (University Safety Association. 1989.

Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1298). Chloromethyl ethyl ether liberates toxic HCl gas upon exposure to benzene (Walker, F. J., Formaldehyde. New York: ACS Monograph Series, 1964, pp. 279) It is likely that other halogenated ethers would produce analogous HX gasses (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions, citation needed).\"},\n",

School Science Review 32(117):249; Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. Vol. 1, pp. 1385.).     Ethanol ignites and explodes on contact with nitrosyl perchlorate (Hoffmak, K.A. et al. 1909. Berichte. 42:2031.).     Ethylene glycol is hypergolic with CrO3, KMnO4, and Na2O2 (Oouchi, H. et al. 1982. Chemical Abstracts 97:8605.).     Glycerol ignites on contact with KMnO4 (British Chemical Industrial Safety Council. 1974. Quarterly Safety Summary 45:11-122.).     Glycerol and chlorine can explode at slightly elevated temperatures (Statesir, W.A. 1973. Chemical Engineering Progress 69(4):54.).     Reaction of BrF5 and ethanol may cause fire or explosion (Mellor, J.W. 1956. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, Supp. 1. p. 172. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).    Ethanol ignites in contact with chromyl chloride (Mellor, J.W. 1943. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 11, p. 396. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).     Reaction of C1-C3 alcohols and barium perchlorate yield highly explosive alkyl perchlorates (Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1964. Volume 5. pp. 75.).     Alcohols can form explosive mixtures with H2O2 (MCA Safety Datasheet 53. Safety Datasheets, Manufacturing Chemists’ Association, Washington. 1969.).     NaBrO3 and KBrO3 can produce explosive compounds with ethylene glycol (Oouchi, H. et al. 1982. Chemical Abstracts 97:8605.).     Methanol and lead perchlorate may form explosive methyl perchlorate (Willard, H.H. et al. 1930. Journal of the American Chemical Society 52:2396.).     Methanol can form explosive methyl hypochlorite in contact with sodium hypochlorite (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1283.).     Ethanol can form explosive ethyl perchlorate with uranyl perchlorate (Eramesta, O. 1942. Suomen Kemist 15B:1.), KClO4 (Burton, H. et al. 1955. Analyst 80:16.), or magnesium perchlorate (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1320.).     Reaction of ethanol with AgNO3 can form explosive silver fulminate and ethyl nitrate (Luchs, J.K. 1966. Photog. Sci. Eng. 10:334.).    Reaction of sodium hypochlorite and ethylene glycol can be violent after a short induction period (Bickerton, J. 1991. Chemistry in Britain 27(6):504.).     P4O6 reacts violently with methanol (Thorpe, T.E. et al. 1890. Journal of the Chemical Society 57:569-573.).     Disulfuryl difluoride and ethanol react violently (Hayek, E. 1951. Monatshefte für Chemie. 82:942.).     Bromine and ethanol react vigorously with heat generation (Muir, G.D. 1972. Chemistry in Britain 8:6.).     Ethanol reacts with hypohalites to form haloforms, but is the only primary alcohol that can undergo this type of reaction (Logsdon, J.E. 2004. Ethanol. In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)).    Methyl and ethyl alcohol may be oxidized to toxic and low-BP formaldehyde and acetaldehyde respectively by strong oxidizing agents such as K2Cr2O7 and KMnO4 (Morrison, R. T. and Boyd, R. N. Organic Chemistry, Allyn and Bacon, Inc, Boston: 1973, pp. 528).    Oxidation of methanol may proceed to CO2 (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 298).    The reaction of ethyl alcohol and calcium hypochlorite yields chloroform, and by extension may also yield fluoroform with calcium hypofluorite (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 304).     The reaction between the [ClO3]- ion and methanol may yield chlorine gas, carbon dioxide and chlorine dioxide gases (Masschelein, W. J. Chlorine Dioxide. Ann Arbor Science Publishers Inc, Ann Arbor, MI: 1979. pp. 120). Ethers WITH Oxidizing Agents, Strong:    Diethyl ether evolves a gas with nitrosyl perchlorate, then explodes (Hoffman, K.A. et al. 1909. Berichte. 42:2031).    Diethyl ether explodes on contact with fluorine nitrate (Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, Brauer, G., (Translation Ed. Riley, R.F.), London, Academic Press, Vol. 1, 1963. pp. 189).    Diethyl ether explodes on contact with sodium peroxide (Fire and Explosion Risks, von Schwartz, E., London, Griffin, 1918, p. 328).    Diethyl ether explodes on contact with trithioazyl perchlorate (Ergebnisse und Probleme der Chemie der Schwefelstickstoff-verbindung, Scientia Chemica, Vol. 9, Goehring, M., Berlin, Akademie Verlag, 1957, pp. 74).    Mixtures of diethyl ether and I2O7 can explosively decompose (Mishra, H.C. et al. 1962. Journal of the Chemical Society pp. 1195-1196).    CrO3 and ethers, including diethyl ether, methyldioxane, and dimethyldioxane, ignite on contact (Fawcett, H.H. 1959. Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 51(4):90A; Mikhailov, V. 1960. Chemical Abstracts 54:23331f; Mellor, J.W. 1943. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 11, p. 235. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).    Diethyl ether also ignites on contact with chromyl chloride (Mellor, J.W. 1943. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 11, p. 396. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.), or with chlorine if light is present (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1298).    Diethyl ether forms an impact and friction-sensitive mixture with liquid air (Danckwort, P.W. 1927. Angew Chem. 40:1317) or silver perchlorate (Heim, F. 1957. Agnew Chem. 69:274).    Diethyl ether forms an explosive salt with uranyl nitrate (Muller, A. 1916. Chem. Ztg. 40:38; Muller, A. 1917. Chem. Ztg. 41:439), and forms explosive peroxides with H2O2 (Bruhl, J.W. 1895. Berichte. 28:2856-2857).    THF forms explosive products with KO2 (Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1992. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 8th Edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. pp. 3227).    Tetrahydrofuran (reaction may be light-promoted) (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 114) and diethyl ether react violently with bromine (Urben 110); if the bromine is impure, diethyl ether may ignite (University Safety Association. 1989. Safety Digest 34:14).    Diethyl ether reacts vigorously with CrO3, Ca(OCl)2, or ClNO2 (Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1992. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 8th Edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. pp. 1614); and dioxane reacts violently with silver perchlorate (Lewis 1449).    Ethers may release toxic chlorine dioxide gas upon treatment with nitrosyl perchlorate (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions). Alcohols and Polyols WITH Halogenating Agents:    Isopropanol can react violently with PBr3, releasing toxic HBr gas (Taylor, D.A.H. 1974. Chemistry in Britain 10:101-102.).     Isopropanol can react with PCl3, forming toxic HCl gas (Logsdon, J.E., R.A. Loke. 1996. Isopropyl Alcohol. In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)).    Glycerol and chlorine can react explosively at slightly elevated temperatures (Statesir, W.A. 1973. Chemical Engineering Progress 69(4):54.).    BrF3 ignites or explodes on contact with most organic compounds, including alcohols (Mellor, J.W. 1941. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, p. 113. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.; 1956, Volume 2, Supplemental 1. pp. 164-167).     Ethanol ignites on contact with IF7 (Booth, H.S. et al. 1947. Chemical Reviews 41:428).     Glycerol and PI3 react violently (Leleu, J., 1974, Les Reactions Chimique Dangereuse, Cahiers de Notes Documentaires, (75), 273).     Ethanol reacts vigorously with UF6 (The Chemical Elements and their Compounds, Sidgwick, N.V., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1950, pp. 1072).    Ethanol is oxidized to low-boiling and poisonous acetaldehyde by chlorine and bromine in the presence of strong bases. The acetaldehyde reacts further under these conditions to generate trihaloacetaldehyde, which itself can react further to generate formate and a haloform. This series of reactions is called the haloform reaction (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 305).    Alcohols likely react with acetyl halides to produce HX gases, including HF and HI not listed above (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions).    Alcohols likely react with PX3 compounds forming toxic HX gases, including HF and HI not listed above (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions). Ethers WITH Halogenating Agents:    Diethyl ether explodes or ignites on contact with BrF3 (Sharpe, A.G. et al. 1948. Journal of the Chemical Society 2136), BrF5 (Mellor, J.W. 1956. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd. Volume 2, Supplemental 1. pp. 172), or ClF3 (Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1992. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 8th Edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. pp. 1614).    Tetrahydrofuran (reaction may be light-promoted) (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 114) and diethyl ether react violently with bromine (Urben 110); if the bromine is impure, diethyl ether may ignite (University Safety Association. 1989. Safety Digest 34:14).    Diethyl ether ignites on contact with IF7 (Booth, H.S. et al. 1947. Chemical Reviews 41:428), or with chlorine if light is present (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1298). Chloromethyl ethyl ether liberates toxic HCl gas upon exposure to benzene (Walker, F. J., Formaldehyde. New York: ACS Monograph Series, 1964, pp. 279) It is likely that other halogenated ethers would produce analogous HX gasses (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions, citation needed).\"},\n",

These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.

Acids, Strong Non-oxidizing WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.

Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.

Polymerizable Compounds WITH Not Chemically Reactive:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 244).  Acids, Strong Non-oxidizing WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Oxidizing Agents, Strong WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.\"},\n",

These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.

Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Volume 2. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 5-6, 192).    Acetylene reacts with copper to form explosive acetylides (Association of British Chemical Manufacturers. 1946. Quarterly Safety Summary 17, 24).    Copper, mercury, or silver, can form explosive acetylides in contact with 3-bromopropyne (Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages (Section 1, ‘Inflammable Liquids’), London, HMSO, 1972, p. 27). Metals, Less Reactive WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    All of the noble metals are catalytically active and react with monomer-type small molecules. In particular, ruthenium and rhodium are alkene oligomerization catalysts, and palladium is used as an alkene polymerization catalyst (Behr, A. 2010. Catalysis, Homogeneous. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.\"},\n",

Non-Redox-Active Inorganic Compounds WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.    Note: some materials that can polymerize in non-radical mechanisms may have issues with these materials.  Examples below:    Al2O3 promotes polymerization of acetaldehyde, even at low temperatures (Fleischmann, G., R. Jira. 2002. Acetaldehyde. In Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. (Online)).    Aqueous solutions of alkali metal salts can catalyze the anionic polymerization of isocyanates at low temperatures (Six, C. and Richter, F. 2003. Isocyanates, Organic. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).    Ethylene oxide can explosively polymerize on contact with iron oxides or aluminum oxides (Gupta, A.K. 1949. J. Soc.

These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.

Carbonate Salts WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Carbonate salts are weak bases that will react with acidic compounds, generating heat and possibly destabilizing polymerizable compounds (Predicted).    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 224. Masson et Cie.).    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Carbonate Salts WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Carbonate salts are weak bases that will react with acidic compounds, generating heat and possibly destabilizing polymerizable compounds (Predicted).    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Polymerization of butadiene is initiated by cobalt metal (Miller, G.H. et al. 1964. Journal of Polymer Science (Part C) 1109-1115).    Acetylenic compounds with replaceable acetylenically bound hydrogen atoms must be kept out of contact with copper, silver, magnesium, mercury, or alloys containing them, to avoid formation of explosive metal acetylides (“Chemical Intermediates”, 1972 Catalogue, 158, Tamaqua (Pa.), Air Products and Chemicals Inc., 1972; Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages, London, HMSO, 1972, Sect. 1, p. 27).

Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.

Polymerizable Compounds WITH Not Chemically Reactive:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Strong acids can add across the carbon-carbon triple bond present in acetylene and acetylene derivatives, resulting in a compound with a carbon-carbon double bond or possibly a carbon-carbon single bond if the addition reaction occurs twice. This reaction may be exothermic (Loudon, Marc. 2002. Organic Chemistry. 4th ed. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 614).    Phenylacetylene explodes on contact with perchloric acid.

Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.\"},\n",

Oxidizing Agents, Strong WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.\"},\n",

P4O6 reacts violently with methanol (Thorpe, T.E. et al. 1890. Journal of the Chemical Society 57:569-573.).     Disulfuryl difluoride and ethanol react violently (Hayek, E. 1951. Monatshefte für Chemie. 82:942.).     Bromine and ethanol react vigorously with heat generation (Muir, G.D. 1972. Chemistry in Britain 8:6.).     Ethanol reacts with hypohalites to form haloforms, but is the only primary alcohol that can undergo this type of reaction (Logsdon, J.E. 2004. Ethanol. In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)).    Methyl and ethyl alcohol may be oxidized to toxic and low-BP formaldehyde and acetaldehyde respectively by strong oxidizing agents such as K2Cr2O7 and KMnO4 (Morrison, R. T. and Boyd, R. N. Organic Chemistry, Allyn and Bacon, Inc, Boston: 1973, pp. 528).    Oxidation of methanol may proceed to CO2 (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 298).    The reaction of ethyl alcohol and calcium hypochlorite yields chloroform, and by extension may also yield fluoroform with calcium hypofluorite (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 304).     The reaction between the [ClO3]- ion and methanol may yield chlorine gas, carbon dioxide and chlorine dioxide gases (Masschelein, W. J. Chlorine Dioxide. Ann Arbor Science Publishers Inc, Ann Arbor, MI: 1979. pp. 120).\"},\n",

These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Acyl Halides, Sulfonyl Halides, and Chloroformates WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

We urge chemists to perform testing to ensure that hazards do not occur under conditions appropriate to the scenario. Reducing Agents, Weak WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Copper, mercury, or silver, can form explosive acetylides in contact with 3-bromopropyne (Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages (Section 1, ‘Inflammable Liquids’), London, HMSO, 1972, p. 27). Metals, Less Reactive WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    All of the noble metals are catalytically active and react with monomer-type small molecules. In particular, ruthenium and rhodium are alkene oligomerization catalysts, and palladium is used as an alkene polymerization catalyst (Behr, A. 2010. Catalysis, Homogeneous. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.\"},\n",

Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Saturated WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Saturated WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.'},\n",

Reaction of ethanol with AgNO3 can form explosive silver fulminate and ethyl nitrate (Luchs, J.K. 1966. Photog. Sci. Eng. 10:334.).    Reaction of sodium hypochlorite and ethylene glycol can be violent after a short induction period (Bickerton, J. 1991. Chemistry in Britain 27(6):504.).     P4O6 reacts violently with methanol (Thorpe, T.E. et al. 1890. Journal of the Chemical Society 57:569-573.).     Disulfuryl difluoride and ethanol react violently (Hayek, E. 1951.

Glycerol and PI3 react violently (Leleu, J., 1974, Les Reactions Chimique Dangereuse, Cahiers de Notes Documentaires, (75), 273).     Ethanol reacts vigorously with UF6 (The Chemical Elements and their Compounds, Sidgwick, N.V., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1950, pp. 1072).    Ethanol is oxidized to low-boiling and poisonous acetaldehyde by chlorine and bromine in the presence of strong bases. The acetaldehyde reacts further under these conditions to generate trihaloacetaldehyde, which itself can react further to generate formate and a haloform. This series of reactions is called the haloform reaction (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 305).    Alcohols likely react with acetyl halides to produce HX gases, including HF and HI not listed above (Predicted by comparison to similar reactions).

    "- \"Metals, Elemental and Powder, Active WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated:    Powdered cobalt incandescently decomposes acetylene on contact, posing a fire hazard (J. W. Mellor, 1942. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 14, pp. 513. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.). Hydrogen gas may be formed in this reaction (Predicted).    Polymerization of butadiene is initiated by cobalt metal (Miller, G.H. et al. 1964. Journal of Polymer Science (Part C) 1109-1115).    Acetylenic compounds with replaceable acetylenically bound hydrogen atoms must be kept out of contact with copper, silver, magnesium, mercury, or alloys containing them, to avoid formation of explosive metal acetylides (“Chemical Intermediates”, 1972 Catalogue, 158, Tamaqua (Pa.), Air Products and Chemicals Inc., 1972; Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages, London, HMSO, 1972, Sect. 1, p. 27). Metals, Elemental and Powder, Active WITH Polymerizable Compounds:    Rapid polymerization of acrylonitrile can be initiated by free radicals, such as alkali or alkali earth metals (Bradzil, J. F. 2010. Acrylonitrile. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)).    Polymerization of butadiene is initiated by cobalt metal (Miller, G.H. et al. 1964. Journal of Polymer Science (Part C) 1109-1115; Miller, G. H.; Eliason, R. R.; Pritchard, G. O.; J. Polymer Science C, 1963, 1109-1115).    Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.    These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.\"\n",

    "#Bad example reasons\n",
    "- \"The molecular weight of this compound compared to simpler compounds suggests higher reactivity.\" (This is too general and does not leverage the provided preliminary reason or provide specific interaction data.)\n",
    "- \"Therefore, the mixture is highly reactive.\" (This conclusion is unsupported by quantitative data or specific conditions that adjust the initial assessment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Good example reasons\n",
    "- \"Uncoated aluminum powder, being an active metal, is highly reactive with bromine, a strong oxidizing agent. This reactivity is due to the high surface area of the uncoated powder form, which facilitates rapid and intense reactions. The interaction between aluminum powder and bromine is expected to be extremely vigorous, leading to the release of a significant amount of energy, potentially resulting in ignition or explosion. Historical evidence from similar reactions, such as aluminum's violent ignition upon contact with chlorine at room temperature and its vigorous reaction with iodine in the presence of water, underscores the hazardous nature of mixing aluminum with halogenating agents. Moreover, the reactive nature of powdered aluminum with various halogenated compounds, including bromine, has been well-documented, indicating a consistent pattern of incompatibility and danger when these substances come into contact. Due to these factors, the mixture of uncoated aluminum powder and bromine is classified as incompatible, with a high likelihood of violent and hazardous reactions occurring even under ambient conditions.\"\n",
    "- \"While there is generally no evidence for hazardous reactions between non-redox-active inorganic compounds and alkynes with acetylenic hydrogen, caution is warranted for the mixture of aluminum oxide and acetylene. This precaution is due to the potential formation of explosive compounds in the presence of metal oxides, analogous to the known reaction where copper oxides in contact with acetylene can form explosive copper acetylide. Although aluminum oxide is not as reactive as copper oxide, the possibility of forming a hazardous compound through a similar mechanism cannot be entirely ruled out, especially in conditions favoring such reactions. Thus, a cautionary approach is recommended until further specific data is available.\"\n",
    "- \"Argon, a noble gas, is known for its chemical inertness due to its complete valence electron shell, which makes it unreactive with most substances, including non-redox-active inorganic compounds like aluminum oxide. There is no known evidence or documented case of a hazardous reaction between argon and aluminum oxide. Argon does not participate in chemical reactions under standard conditions, and aluminum oxide is a stable, non-reactive oxide that does not easily form compounds with inert gases. Therefore, the combination of argon and aluminum oxide is considered compatible, with no risk of hazardous interactions or reactivity under normal handling and storage conditions.\"\n",
