Non-Redox-Active Inorganic Compounds WITH Alkynes, with Acetylenic Hydrogen:

   In most cases, no evidence was found for a hazardous reaction between non-redox-active inorganic compounds and alkynes with an attached hydrogen atom. However, in some cases, a hazardous product can be formed:

   The explosive compound copper acetylide (Cu2C2) can be formed when copper salts or copper oxides come into contact with acetylene (Pässler, P., et al. 2011. Acetylene. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online))."

Metals, Elemental and Powder, Active WITH Alkynes, with Acetylenic Hydrogen:

   Acetylenic compounds with replaceable acetylenically bound hydrogen atoms must be kept out of contact with copper, silver, magnesium, mercury, or alloys containing them, to avoid formation of explosive metal acetylides (“Chemical Intermediates”, 1972 Catalogue, 158, Tamaqua (Pa.), Air Products and Chemicals Inc., 1972; Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages, London, HMSO, 1972, Sect. 1, p. 27).

   Powdered cobalt incandescently decomposes acetylene on contact, posing a fire hazard (J. W. Mellor, 1942. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 14, pp. 513. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.)."

Metals, Elemental and Powder, Active WITH Non-Redox-Active Inorganic Compounds:

   Mixtures of powdered electropositive metals (such as aluminum, magnesium, titanium, zinc, or zirconium) with certain metal oxides (such as those of iron, barium, chromium, cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum, lead, vanadium, nickel, or silicon) react explosively and at extremely high temperatures once ignited. These mixtures are called thermites (P. J. Roebuck, Educ. Chem., 1979, 16, 178-9; G. V. Ivanov, et al., Chem. Abs., 1979, 91, 76323; M. B. Ismailov, et al., Fizika Goreniya i Vzryva, 1992, 28(1), 46; J. W. Mellor, 1961. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 7, pp. 20.

   Neutral solutions of salts of heavy metals such as nickel, iron, and copper are corrosive to magnesium alloys. The metals in the salts are reduced, and the resulting powders can be pyrophoric (Aune, T. K., et al. 2003. Magnesium Alloys. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Zinc can ignite on contact with ammonium chloride, if water is present (G. Sorbe, 1968, Giftige und Explosive Substanzen, Frankfurt, Umschau Verlag, pp. 158; Hanson, R.M. 1976. Journal of Chemical Education 53:578).

   Aluminum can react violently with AgCl if the silver chloride is in excess (Anon. 1954. Chemical and Engineering News 32:258; J. W. Mellor, 1946. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 3, pp. 402. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.)."

Bases, Weak WITH Alkynes, with Acetylenic Hydrogen:

   When acetylene comes into contact with ammoniacal or alkaline solutions of copper (II) salts, explosive copper acetylides can be formed. Silver and mercury salts will also give explosive acetylides in contact with acetylene (Bretherick, L. 1996. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards. Vol. 2, p 191-192. Fifth Ed. Urben, P.G., Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA).

   Mixtures of acetylenic compounds with other weak bases in the presence of metal salts may also result in the formation of explosive metal acetylides. Caution should be used before proceeding. Further research of comparable examples in the literature or very small scale, carefully controlled experiments may be needed to fully assess compatibility."

   Magnesium can react with nitrogen to form the unstable compound magnesium nitride (Mg3N2). If sufficient nitrogen is present this reaction can be self-sustaining. The nitride produced can react with water to form ammonia (Kramer, D. A. 2010. Magnesium and Magnesium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. 1–55. (Online)).

   Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and halons (chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants) will react with molten magnesium (Amundsen, K., et al. 2003. Magnesium. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Many powdered metals, including magnesium, zirconium, titanium, magnesium-aluminum alloy, aluminum, chromium, and manganese, are ignitable and explosive when suspended in a carbon dioxide atmosphere (Hartmann, I., Ind. Eng. Chem., 1948, 40, p. 756; Rhein, R. A., Report No. CR-60125, Washington, NASA, 1964; Guntz, A. et al, Compt. Rendus, 1897, 124, 187-190).

   Magnesium and aluminum form flammable mixtures with finely divided polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) (Anon. 1969. Indust. Res. (9):15; Pittaluga, F. et al., Termotechnica, 1981, 25, p. 332-334).

   Alkali and alkali earth metals dissolved in ammonia can perform stepwise one-electron reductions of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of proton sources (inc. alcohols, water, or ammonium salts). The reaction produces 1,4-cyclohexadienes (Birch reduction) or cyclohexenes (Benkeser reduction) (A. A. Akhrem, I. G. Reshetova, Y. A.

   Alkali and alkali earth metals dissolved in ammonia can perform stepwise one-electron reductions of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of proton sources (inc. alcohols, water, or ammonium salts). The reaction produces 1,4-cyclohexadienes (Birch reduction) or cyclohexenes (Benkeser reduction) (A. A. Akhrem, I. G. Reshetova, Y. A. Titov: Birch Reductions of Aromatic Compounds, IFI/Plenum, New York 1972; E. M. Kaiser, Synthesis, 1972, (8), p. 391-415).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   Powdered cobalt incandescently decomposes acetylene on contact, posing a fire hazard (J. W. Mellor, 1942. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 14, pp. 513. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.). Hydrogen gas may be formed in this reaction (Predicted).

   Polymerization of butadiene is initiated by cobalt metal (Miller, G.H. et al. 1964. Journal of Polymer Science (Part C) 1109-1115).

   Acetylenic compounds with replaceable acetylenically bound hydrogen atoms must be kept out of contact with copper, silver, magnesium, mercury, or alloys containing them, to avoid formation of explosive metal acetylides (“Chemical Intermediates”, 1972 Catalogue, 158, Tamaqua (Pa.), Air Products and Chemicals Inc., 1972; Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages, London, HMSO, 1972, Sect. 1, p. 27).

   Acetylene reacts violently or explosively with most oxidants (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 265.). 

   Reaction of acetylene and halogens may be explosive, particularly if ultraviolet light (including sunlight) is present (Fire and Explosion Risks, von Schwartz, E., London, Griffin, 1918, p. 142, 312; MCA Safety Datasheet 7, Manufacturing Chemists’ Association, Washington, 1957). 

   Reaction of ethylene and chlorine can be explosive if ultraviolet light (including sunlight), mercury oxides, or silver oxide is present (National Fire Protection Association. 1975. Publication 491M. pp. 103.). 

   Propene can polymerize explosively at ambient temperatures in contact with lithium nitrate and sulfur dioxide, if light is present (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 434.). 

   Dienes, including 1,3-butadiene and cyclopentadiene, will explode in contact with nitrogen oxides at low temperatures; non-conjugated alkenes can ignite in contact with NO at ambient temperatures (Haseba, S. et al. 1966. Chemical Engineering Progress 62(4):92.). 

   Acetylene can form explosive chloroacetylenes on contact with hypochlorites (Unfalle beim Chemischen Arbeiten, Rust, E., Ebert, A., Zurich, Rascher Verlag, 2nd edition, 1948, pp. 338.). 

   Acetylene or ethylene form explosive mixtures with trifluoromethyl hypofluorite (Allison, J.A. et al. 1959. Journal of the American Chemical Society 81:1089-1091.) or ozone (Traite de Chimie Organique, Grignard, V., Paris, Masson, 1935, Volume 3. pp. 166.). 

   Butadiene can form explosive peroxides and NO-derivatives if exposed to oxygen and oxides of nitrogen (Fire Protection Manual for Hydrocarbon Processing Plants, Vervalin, C. H. (Ed.), Houston, Gulf Publishing Co., 2nd Edition, 1973, pp. 63-65.). 

   Alkenes can form explosive ozonides or peroxides in contact with ozone (The Chemical Elements and their Compounds, Sidgwick, N.V., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1950. pp. 862.). 

   Ethylene can polymerize at low pressure if catalysts such as molybdenum oxide or CrO3 are present (Sundaram, K.M, M.M. Shreehan, and E.F. Olszewski. 2001. Ethylene. In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)).

   Acetylene can form explosive chloroacetylenes on contact with hypochlorites (Unfalle beim Chemischen Arbeiten, Rust, E., Ebert, A., Zurich, Rascher Verlag, 2nd edition, 1948, pp. 338).

   Bromine and chlorine add across carbon-carbon double or triple bonds to generate halogenated hydrocarbons (Loudon, Marc. 2002. Organic Chemistry. 4th ed. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 160-164, 614). This reaction is very rapid and exothermic.

   Propene can polymerize explosively at ambient temperatures in contact with lithium nitrate and sulfur dioxide, if light is present (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 434.). 

   Dienes, including 1,3-butadiene and cyclopentadiene, will explode in contact with nitrogen oxides at low temperatures; non-conjugated alkenes can ignite in contact with NO at ambient temperatures (Haseba, S. et al. 1966. Chemical Engineering Progress 62(4):92.). 

   Acetylene can form explosive chloroacetylenes on contact with hypochlorites (Unfalle beim Chemischen Arbeiten, Rust, E., Ebert, A., Zurich, Rascher Verlag, 2nd edition, 1948, pp. 338.). 

   Acetylene or ethylene form explosive mixtures with trifluoromethyl hypofluorite (Allison, J.A. et al. 1959. Journal of the American Chemical Society 81:1089-1091.) or ozone (Traite de Chimie Organique, Grignard, V., Paris, Masson, 1935, Volume 3. pp. 166.). 

   Butadiene can form explosive peroxides and NO-derivatives if exposed to oxygen and oxides of nitrogen (Fire Protection Manual for Hydrocarbon Processing Plants, Vervalin, C. H. (Ed.), Houston, Gulf Publishing Co., 2nd Edition, 1973, pp. 63-65.).

   Bromine and chlorine add across carbon-carbon double or triple bonds to generate halogenated hydrocarbons (Loudon, Marc. 2002. Organic Chemistry. 4th ed. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 160-164, 614). This reaction is very rapid and exothermic.

   Unsaturated hydrocarbons may liberate toxic HX and halocarbon gases upon exposure to strong halogenating agents (Predicted).

Oxidizing Agents, Strong WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

Polymerizable Compounds WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   In general most monomers, especially those of a similar nature such as acrylates, styrenics, etc. are compatible at ambient conditions.  However, due to the complex inhibition mechanisms which may or may not involve dissolved oxygen, caution should be used when two monomers are mixed accidentally.  Consequently, inadvertent mixtures need to be vetted carefully on an individual basis. Further research of comparable examples in the literature or very small scale, carefully controlled experiments may be needed to fully assess compatibility.

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated:

   No evidence was found for a hazardous reaction between these reactive groups.

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   Strong acids can initiate the exothermic polymerization of olefins. These reactions can be violent (Rich, G. A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 244). 


Acids, Strong Non-oxidizing WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

   CCl4 and other chloromethanes are explosively reactive with aluminum (Stern, M., H.H. Uhlig. 1953. Journal of the Electrochemical Society 100:543), as are chlorobenzenes (Krishnamurti, R. 2003.

Metals, Elemental and Powder, Active WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated:

   Powdered cobalt incandescently decomposes acetylene on contact, posing a fire hazard (J. W. Mellor, 1942. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 14, pp. 513. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.). Hydrogen gas may be formed in this reaction (Predicted).

   Polymerization of butadiene is initiated by cobalt metal (Miller, G.H. et al. 1964. Journal of Polymer Science (Part C) 1109-1115).

   Acetylenic compounds with replaceable acetylenically bound hydrogen atoms must be kept out of contact with copper, silver, magnesium, mercury, or alloys containing them, to avoid formation of explosive metal acetylides (“Chemical Intermediates”, 1972 Catalogue, 158, Tamaqua (Pa.), Air Products and Chemicals Inc., 1972; Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages, London, HMSO, 1972, Sect. 1, p. 27).

Metals, Elemental and Powder, Active WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Rapid polymerization of acrylonitrile can be initiated by free radicals, such as alkali or alkali earth metals (Bradzil, J. F. 2010. Acrylonitrile. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)).

   Polymerization of butadiene is initiated by cobalt metal (Miller, G.H. et al. 1964. Journal of Polymer Science (Part C) 1109-1115; Miller, G. H.; Eliason, R. R.; Pritchard, G. O.; J. Polymer Science C, 1963, 1109-1115).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Saturated:

   No evidence was found for a hazardous reaction between these reactive groups. 

Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Saturated WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   Oxygen difluoride reacts exothermically with aluminum oxide (alumina). This reaction can be explosive under certain conditions (e.g. confinement) (Streng, A. G., Chem. Eng. News, 1965, 43(12), 5).

   Titanium dioxide is not easily oxidized under normal conditions (Swiler, D. R. 2005. Pigments, Inorganic. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)).

   Alkenes can form explosive ozonides or peroxides in contact with ozone (The Chemical Elements and their Compounds, Sidgwick, N.V., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1950. pp. 862.). 

   Ethylene can polymerize at low pressure if catalysts such as molybdenum oxide or CrO3 are present (Sundaram, K.M, M.M. Shreehan, and E.F. Olszewski. 2001. Ethylene. In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)).

Oxidizing Agents, Strong WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated:

   No evidence was found for a hazardous reaction between these reactive groups.

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Metals, Less Reactive WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   All of the noble metals are catalytically active and react with monomer-type small molecules. In particular, ruthenium and rhodium are alkene oligomerization catalysts, and palladium is used as an alkene polymerization catalyst (Behr, A. 2010. Catalysis, Homogeneous. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   Palladium is rapidly attacked by concentrated HBr and HI at room temperature (Seymour, R. J. and O'Farrelly, J. I. 2001. Platinum-Group Metals. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)). 

   HCl, HBr, and HI react with copper at ambient temperatures, especially when in contact with air. Flammable hydrogen gas is produced (Mellor, J.W. 1923. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 3, p. 81. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd).

   The halogen acids attack tin, particularly when hot and concentrated (Gaver, C. C. and Updated by Staff 2005. Tin and Tin Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)).

   Mercury is little affected by hydrochloric acid (DeVito, S. C. and Brooks, W. E. 2005. Mercury. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)). "

Metals, Less Reactive WITH Oxidizing Agents, Strong:

   Mercury combines readily with the halogens (DeVito, S. C. and Brooks, W. E. 2005. Mercury. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online); MCA Safety Data Sheet 49, Manufacturing Chemists’ Association, Washington, 1968).

   Chlorine, bromine, and iodine readily react with tin; with fluorine, the action is slow at room temperature (Gaver, C. C. and Updated by Staff 2005. Tin and Tin Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)).

   Iodine bromide reacts violently with tin (Pascal, P. 1963. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 8, Part 3, p. 308. Masson et Cie.).

   Silver, copper, tin, and lead react violently and may ignite on contact with ClF3 (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1237).

   Powdered copper will burn in chlorine (Mellor, J.W. 1967. Mellor’s Modern Inorganic Chemistry, 6th Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. pp. 649). 

   Silver, platinum, gold, copper, and lead can catalyze exothermic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, releasing combustion-promoting O2 gas (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1531; Winnacker. 1970. Volume 2. pp. 552).

   Copper reacts incandescently with KO2 (J. W. Mellor, 1941. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, pp. 493. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

   Silver can cause explosive decomposition of ozonides (Rieche, A. et al. Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie (1942), 553, 187-249).
 
   Copper and many other metals cause hydrazinium nitrate to ignite and decompose at 70 C (J. W. Mellor, 1940. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 8, pp. 327. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.; J. W. Mellor, 1967. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 8, Supp. 2, pp. 84, 96. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

   Copper forms shock and friction-sensitive mixtures with bromate, chlorate, and iodate salts (J. W. Mellor, 1946. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, pp. 310. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

Non-Redox-Active Inorganic Compounds WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

   Note: some materials that can polymerize in non-radical mechanisms may have issues with these materials.  Examples below:

   Al2O3 promotes polymerization of acetaldehyde, even at low temperatures (Fleischmann, G., R. Jira. 2002. Acetaldehyde. In Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. (Online)).

   Aqueous solutions of alkali metal salts can catalyze the anionic polymerization of isocyanates at low temperatures (Six, C. and Richter, F. 2003. Isocyanates, Organic. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Ethylene oxide can explosively polymerize on contact with iron oxides or aluminum oxides (Gupta, A.K. 1949. J. Soc. Chem. Ind. 68:179)."

Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated WITH Sulfides, Inorganic:

Sulfides, Inorganic WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Carbonate Salts WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Carbonate salts are weak bases that will react with acidic compounds, generating heat and possibly destabilizing polymerizable compounds (Predicted).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online); Ackermann, R. and Lange, L. 2000. Sodium Compounds, Organic. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)). Alkanes with fewer than five carbon atoms are flammable gases.	

   Reaction between sodium and 1-chlorobutane may accelerate to explosion unless kept close to -23 C (Shackelford, S.A. 1970. Journal of Organic Chemistry 44:3492, footnote 30).

   Poly-tetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) ignites on contact with potassium, cesium, or sodium-potassium alloy, even in the absence of oxygen (National Fire Protection Association. 1975. Publication 491M. pp. 394; Burkhardt, E. R. 2006. Potassium and Potassium Alloys. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Lithium, sodium, potassium, and Na-K alloy form highly shock-sensitive explosive mixtures with many halocarbons, including chloroethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, bromoform, dibromomethane, diiodomethane, tetrachloroethane, pentachloroethane, and carbon tetrachloride. In some cases, highly basic metal alkyls are formed (Staudinger, H. 1922. Agnew. Chem. 35:657; Staudinger, H. 1925. Z. Elektrochem. 31:549; Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 39. Masson et Cie.).

   Sodium reacts violently with organic halides (Lemke, C.H., V.H. Markant. 2005. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)). Halogenated organics may liberate toxic HX gases upon exposure to group I metals (Predicted)."

Metals, Alkali, Very Active WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated:

   Some unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as isoprene, butadiene, and styrene, polymerize at room temperature on contact with sodium having a high surface area (powder or a thin layer) (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 224. Masson et Cie.). 

   Potassium reacts with acetylene even at cold temperatures to form reactive potassium carbide (K2C2) and possibly hydrogen gas. When this reaction is warmed, it results in a fire (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 2, p. 31. Masson et Cie.).

   Heated potassium reacts with ethylene to form potassium carbide (K2C2) and possibly hydrogen gas (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 2, p. 31. Masson et Cie.).   

   Heated lithium reacts incandescently with ethylene and acetylene, forming explosive lithium carbide (Li2C2) and pyrophoric lithium hydride (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 38, 137. Masson et Cie.).

   Liquid potassium ignites and explodes in acetylene (Berthelot, M. 1866. Bull. Soc. Chim. (France) [2] 5:188). 

   Liquid sodium reacts with acetylene to form reactive sodium carbide (Na2C2) and sodium acetylide (NaC2H) and flammable hydrogen gas (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 224, 867. Masson et Cie.). 

Metals, Alkali, Very Active WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Rapid polymerization of acrylonitrile can be initiated by free radicals, such as alkali metals (Bradzil, J. F. 2010. Acrylonitrile. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)). 

   Some unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as isoprene, butadiene, and styrene, polymerize at room temperature on contact with sodium having a high surface area (powder or a thin layer) (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 224. Masson et Cie.).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

Metals, Alkali, Very Active WITH Sulfides, Inorganic:

   Exposure of sodium to H2S can cause a fire. In the presence of moisture, a rapid reaction occurs, forming corrosive sodium sulfide and possibly flammable hydrogen gas (Leleu, J., 1975, Les Reactions Chimique Dangereuse, Cahiers de Notes Documentaires, (79), p. 268, 270; Eggeman, T. and Updated by Staff 2007. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)).

   CS2 forms an explosive mixture with sodium or Na-K alloy. Mixtures of CS2 and any group I metals are shock-sensitive (Leleu, J., 1975, Les Reactions Chimique Dangereuse, Cahiers de Notes Documentaires, (79), p. 267; Staudinger, H.Z. 1922. Agnew. Chem. 35:659). 

   CS2 reacts violently with sodium to form corrosive sodium sulfide (Eggeman, T. and Updated by Staff 2007. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)). 

   Some heavy metal sulfides are reduced by metallic sodium, forming corrosive sodium sulfide and releasing possibly toxic heavy metals (Eggeman, T. and Updated by Staff 2007. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)). 

   Lithium violently reduces iron (II) sulfide to iron metal (Dickinson, F. 1967. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, Supplement 2, p. 81-82. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.). "

Metals, Alkali, Very Active WITH Carbonate Salts:

   No evidence was found for hazardous interactions between alkali metals and carbonate salts at ambient conditions. Hazardous reactions do occur at elevated temperatures, however, which is important due to the widespread use of carbonates and bicarbonates as fire extinguishing agents. Carbonates and bicarbonates should never be used to extinguish metal fires. 

   Burning sodium-potassium alloy reacts violently with sodium bicarbonate (Hazardous Chemical Reactions, NFPA 491M, Quincy (MA), National Fire Protection Association, 10th ed., 1991).

   Burning lithium reacts violently with sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate (Dickinson, F. 1961. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, Supplement 2, p. 25. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

   Above 700C, sodium carbonate and sodium metal react to form sodium carbide (Na2C2), which is itself a very strong base which can react with water to form flammable acetylene gas (Eggeman, T. and Updated by Staff 2007.

Carbonate Salts WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Carbonate salts are weak bases that will react with acidic compounds, generating heat and possibly destabilizing polymerizable compounds (Predicted).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   Polymerization of butadiene is initiated by cobalt metal (Miller, G.H. et al. 1964. Journal of Polymer Science (Part C) 1109-1115).

   Acetylenic compounds with replaceable acetylenically bound hydrogen atoms must be kept out of contact with copper, silver, magnesium, mercury, or alloys containing them, to avoid formation of explosive metal acetylides (“Chemical Intermediates”, 1972 Catalogue, 158, Tamaqua (Pa.), Air Products and Chemicals Inc., 1972; Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages, London, HMSO, 1972, Sect. 1, p. 27).

Metals, Elemental and Powder, Active WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Rapid polymerization of acrylonitrile can be initiated by free radicals, such as alkali or alkali earth metals (Bradzil, J. F. 2010. Acrylonitrile. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)).

   Polymerization of butadiene is initiated by cobalt metal (Miller, G.H. et al. 1964. Journal of Polymer Science (Part C) 1109-1115; Miller, G. H.; Eliason, R. R.; Pritchard, G. O.; J. Polymer Science C, 1963, 1109-1115).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Polymerizable Compounds WITH Not Chemically Reactive:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   Sodium and potassium metal react with dry nitrogen in the presence of an electric discharge to form explosive metal nitrides and metal azides. Otherwise, there is no reaction between these metals and nitrogen gas (even when heated) (Eggeman, T. 2007. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online); Dickinson, F. 1961. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, Supplement 3, p. 1565. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

   Potassium and cesium react violently with Teflon equipment even under inert atmosphere; therefore, Teflon-coated stirbars or gaskets in equipment or valves should not be allowed to contact these metals (Burkhardt, E. R. 2006. Potassium and Potassium Alloys. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Molten alkali metals react vigorously with carbon dioxide. CO2 should never be used to extinguish a metal fire (Dickinson, F. 1961.

Acids, Strong Oxidizing WITH Alkynes, with Acetylenic Hydrogen:

   Acetylene and HNO3 react to liberate toxic NOx and inert CO2 gases (Copenhaver, J. W. and Bigelow M. H. Acetylene and Carbon Monoxide Chemistry. New York: Reinhold Publishing Co, 1949, pp. 23).

   Strong acids can add across the carbon-carbon triple bond present in acetylene and acetylene derivatives, resulting in a compound with a carbon-carbon double bond or possibly a carbon-carbon single bond if the addition reaction occurs twice. This reaction may be exothermic (Loudon, Marc. 2002. Organic Chemistry. 4th ed. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 614).

   Phenylacetylene explodes on contact with perchloric acid. This can even occur at cryogenic temperatures if a dilutant is not present (Martheard, J.P. et al. 1982. Tetrahedron Letters 23:3484.). 

   Acetylene reacts violently or explosively with most oxidants (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 265.).

   Dienes and alkynes form hypergolic (spontaneously explosive) mixtures with HNO3 (Andrussow, L. 1961. Chim. Ind. (Paris) 86:542).

   Strong oxidizing acids, such as sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, or nitric acid, can catalyze exothermic alkyne-hydration reactions, which produce aldehydes and ketones (Loudon, Marc. 2002. Organic Chemistry. 4th ed. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 615).

   Strong oxidizing acids can initiate the exothermic polymerization of olefins. These reactions can be violent (Rich, G. A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 251). Alkynes may react in a similar way."

Acids, Strong Oxidizing WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated:

   Phenylacetylene explodes on contact with perchloric acid. This can even occur at cryogenic temperatures if a dilutant is not present (Martheard, J.P. et al. 1982. Tetrahedron Letters 23:3484.). 

   Acetylene reacts violently or explosively with most oxidants (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 265.).

   Cyclopentadiene reacts explosively with HNO3 or concentrated H2SO4 (Wilson, P.J. et al. 1944. Chemical Reviews 38:8.). 

   Aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbons are very susceptible to oxidation by strong oxidizing acids, which can result in heat generation and fire (Rich, G. A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 249).

   Addition of mineral acids to alkenes can result in exothermic alkene-addition reactions, forming alkyl sulfates in the case of sulfuric acid (Rich, G. A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 242). 

   Strong oxidizing acids, such as sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, or nitric acid, can catalyze exothermic alkene-hydration reactions, which produce alcohols (Loudon, Marc. 2002. Organic Chemistry. 4th ed. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 152).

   Strong oxidizing acids can initiate the exothermic polymerization of olefins. These reactions can be violent (Rich, G. A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 251).

   Acetylene and HNO3 react to liberate toxic NOx and inert CO2 gases (Copenhaver, J. W. and Bigelow M. H. Acetylene and Carbon Monoxide Chemistry. New York: Reinhold Publishing Co, 1949, pp. 23).

   Dienes and alkynes form hypergolic (spontaneously explosive) mixtures with HNO3 (Andrussow, L. 1961. Chim. Ind. (Paris) 86:542).

Acids, Strong Oxidizing WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Acids or acid fumes promote violent polymerization of acrolein (MCA Safety Datasheet 85, Manufacturing Chemists’ Association, Washington, 1961; Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 417; Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1992. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 8th Edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. pp. 63).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

Oxidizing Agents, Strong WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Analyst 80:16.), or magnesium perchlorate (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1320.). 

   Reaction of ethanol with AgNO3 can form explosive silver fulminate and ethyl nitrate (Luchs, J.K. 1966. Photog. Sci. Eng. 10:334.).

   Bromine and ethanol react vigorously with heat generation (Muir, G.D. 1972. Chemistry in Britain 8:6.). 

   Ethanol reacts with hypohalites to form haloforms, but is the only primary alcohol that can undergo this type of reaction (Logsdon, J.E. 2004. Ethanol. In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)).

   Methyl and ethyl alcohol may be oxidized to toxic and low-BP formaldehyde and acetaldehyde respectively by strong oxidizing agents such as K2Cr2O7 and KMnO4 (Morrison, R. T. and Boyd, R. N. Organic Chemistry, Allyn and Bacon, Inc, Boston: 1973, pp. 528).

   Oxidation of methanol may proceed to CO2 (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 298).

   The reaction of ethyl alcohol and calcium hypochlorite yields chloroform, and by extension may also yield fluoroform with calcium hypofluorite (Rodd, E. H, ed. Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1951, vol. 1a, pp. 304). 

   The reaction between the [ClO3]- ion and methanol may yield chlorine gas, carbon dioxide and chlorine dioxide gases (Masschelein, W. J. Chlorine Dioxide. Ann Arbor Science Publishers Inc, Ann Arbor, MI: 1979. pp. 120)."

Phenols and Cresols WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   Reactions between acyl halides and ethers are exothermic and may cause pressurization. Secondary and tertiary ethers are most likely to spontaneously react, particularly if catalyzed by a metal chloride. Esters and alkyl chlorides are produced, along with small quantities of alkenes and HCl. (Koenst, W.M.B. 1981. Journal of Hazardous Materials 4:291-298).

Acyl Halides, Sulfonyl Halides, and Chloroformates WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Reducing Agents, Weak WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Metals, Less Reactive WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   All of the noble metals are catalytically active and react with monomer-type small molecules. In particular, ruthenium and rhodium are alkene oligomerization catalysts, and palladium is used as an alkene polymerization catalyst (Behr, A. 2010. Catalysis, Homogeneous. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Saturated WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Saturated WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   After an induction period, MeOH/CCl4 can dissolve active metals such as Al, Mg, and Zn, and the dissolution process is rapid and exothermic. Flammable H2 or CH4 gases may be produced. Methanol forms highly explosive mixtures with aluminum or magnesium (Shidlovskii, A.A. 1947. Chemical Abstracts 41:1105d), and the mixing process can be violent (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1658; Kuppers, J.R. 1978. Journal of the Electrochemical Society 125:97-98).

Non-Redox-Active Inorganic Compounds WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

   Note: some materials that can polymerize in non-radical mechanisms may have issues with these materials.  Examples below:

   Al2O3 promotes polymerization of acetaldehyde, even at low temperatures (Fleischmann, G., R. Jira. 2002. Acetaldehyde. In Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. (Online)).

   Aqueous solutions of alkali metal salts can catalyze the anionic polymerization of isocyanates at low temperatures (Six, C. and Richter, F. 2003. Isocyanates, Organic. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Ethylene oxide can explosively polymerize on contact with iron oxides or aluminum oxides (Gupta, A.K. 1949. J. Soc. Chem. Ind. 68:179)."

Nitrides, Phosphides, Carbides, and Silicides WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Phenols and Cresols WITH Nitrides, Phosphides, Carbides, and Silicides:

    The combination of weak acids, such as phenol, with nitrides, phosphides, carbides, and silicides will generate flammable and toxic products, including the gases ammonia, phosphine, methane, and silane. Caution should be used before proceeding. Further research of comparable examples in the literature or very small scale, carefully controlled experiments may be needed to fully assess compatibility. The generation of gases may be rather slow, however confinement may lead to dangerous conditions.

Siloxanes WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Oxidizing Agents, Strong WITH Fluoride Salts, Soluble:

   Chlorine dioxide may react with some metal fluorides to liberate toxic fluorine gas (Masschelein, W. J. Chlorine Dioxide. Ann Arbor, MI: Ann Arbor Science Publishers Inc., 1979 pp. 40).

   Hydrofluoric acid forms the powerful oxidizer HgF2 when it reacts with HgO; reactions involving a HF/HgO mixture and organic materials must be run at low temperature to avoid a runaway reaction (Ormston, J. 1944. School Science Review 26(98):32). 

   Lead (II) fluoride and silver fluoride react vigorously with fluorine gas. When aqueous solutions of silver fluoride react with fluorine, ozone-rich oxygen is released (Urben, P.G. 1995.

Metals, Alkali, Very Active WITH Carbonate Salts:

   No evidence was found for hazardous interactions between alkali metals and carbonate salts at ambient conditions. Hazardous reactions do occur at elevated temperatures, however, which is important due to the widespread use of carbonates and bicarbonates as fire extinguishing agents. Carbonates and bicarbonates should never be used to extinguish metal fires. 

   Burning sodium-potassium alloy reacts violently with sodium bicarbonate (Hazardous Chemical Reactions, NFPA 491M, Quincy (MA), National Fire Protection Association, 10th ed., 1991).

   Burning lithium reacts violently with sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate (Dickinson, F. 1961. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, Supplement 2, p. 25. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online); Ackermann, R. and Lange, L. 2000. Sodium Compounds, Organic. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)). Alkanes with fewer than five carbon atoms are flammable gases.	

   Reaction between sodium and 1-chlorobutane may accelerate to explosion unless kept close to -23 C (Shackelford, S.A. 1970. Journal of Organic Chemistry 44:3492, footnote 30).

   Poly-tetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) ignites on contact with potassium, cesium, or sodium-potassium alloy, even in the absence of oxygen (National Fire Protection Association. 1975. Publication 491M. pp. 394; Burkhardt, E. R. 2006. Potassium and Potassium Alloys. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Lithium, sodium, potassium, and Na-K alloy form highly shock-sensitive explosive mixtures with many halocarbons, including chloroethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, bromoform, dibromomethane, diiodomethane, tetrachloroethane, pentachloroethane, and carbon tetrachloride. In some cases, highly basic metal alkyls are formed (Staudinger, H. 1922. Agnew. Chem. 35:657; Staudinger, H. 1925. Z. Elektrochem. 31:549; Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale.

   Potassium reacts with acetylene even at cold temperatures to form reactive potassium carbide (K2C2) and possibly hydrogen gas. When this reaction is warmed, it results in a fire (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 2, p. 31. Masson et Cie.).

   Heated potassium reacts with ethylene to form potassium carbide (K2C2) and possibly hydrogen gas (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 2, p. 31. Masson et Cie.).   

   Heated lithium reacts incandescently with ethylene and acetylene, forming explosive lithium carbide (Li2C2) and pyrophoric lithium hydride (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 38, 137. Masson et Cie.).

   Liquid potassium ignites and explodes in acetylene (Berthelot, M. 1866. Bull. Soc. Chim. (France) [2] 5:188). 

   Liquid sodium reacts with acetylene to form reactive sodium carbide (Na2C2) and sodium acetylide (NaC2H) and flammable hydrogen gas (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 224, 867. Masson et Cie.). 

Metals, Alkali, Very Active WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Rapid polymerization of acrylonitrile can be initiated by free radicals, such as alkali metals (Bradzil, J. F. 2010. Acrylonitrile. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. (Online)). 

   Some unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as isoprene, butadiene, and styrene, polymerize at room temperature on contact with sodium having a high surface area (powder or a thin layer) (Pascal, P. 1966. Nouveau Traité de Chimie Minérale. Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 224. Masson et Cie.).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

   When the reactions mentioned above are performed in a controlled fashion, the metals from the salts are reduced to finely divided and highly reactive metal powders, which are often pyrophoric in air (Rieke, R.D. Accounts of Chemical Research, 1977, 10, p. 301-305). 

   The reductions of many metal oxides by warm lithium are violently exothermic (Bretherick, L. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 4th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1649).

Non-Redox-Active Inorganic Compounds WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

   Note: some materials that can polymerize in non-radical mechanisms may have issues with these materials.  Examples below:

   Al2O3 promotes polymerization of acetaldehyde, even at low temperatures (Fleischmann, G., R. Jira. 2002. Acetaldehyde. In Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. (Online)).

   Aqueous solutions of alkali metal salts can catalyze the anionic polymerization of isocyanates at low temperatures (Six, C. and Richter, F. 2003. Isocyanates, Organic. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Ethylene oxide can explosively polymerize on contact with iron oxides or aluminum oxides (Gupta, A.K. 1949. J. Soc. Chem. Ind. 68:179)."

Metals, Alkali, Very Active WITH Non-Redox-Active Inorganic Compounds:

   Sodium, potassium, and sodium-potassium alloy form shock-sensitive explosive mixtures with halide salts of metals or metalloids (except those of the alkali or alkaline earth metals) (Dickinson, F. 1961. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, Supplement 2, p. 497, 563. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.; Dickinson, F. 1961.

New York: Chemical Publishing Co.).

   When the reactions mentioned above are performed in a controlled fashion, the metals from the salts are reduced to finely divided and highly reactive metal powders, which are often pyrophoric in air (Rieke, R.D. Accounts of Chemical Research, 1977, 10, p. 301-305). 

   The reductions of many metal oxides by warm lithium are violently exothermic (Bretherick, L. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 4th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1649).

   Sodium reduces many metal oxides, including the oxides of alkali metals, mercury, cadmium, zinc, and iron (Eggeman, T. 2007. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)). "

   Reaction of acetylene and halogens may be explosive, particularly if ultraviolet light (including sunlight) is present (Fire and Explosion Risks, von Schwartz, E., London, Griffin, 1918, p. 142, 312; MCA Safety Datasheet 7, Manufacturing Chemists’ Association, Washington, 1957). 

   Reaction of ethylene and chlorine can be explosive if ultraviolet light (including sunlight), mercury oxides, or silver oxide is present (National Fire Protection Association. 1975. Publication 491M. pp. 103.). 

   Propene can polymerize explosively at ambient temperatures in contact with lithium nitrate and sulfur dioxide, if light is present (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 434.).

   Alkenes can form explosive ozonides or peroxides in contact with ozone (The Chemical Elements and their Compounds, Sidgwick, N.V., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1950. pp. 862.). 

   Ethylene can polymerize at low pressure if catalysts such as molybdenum oxide or CrO3 are present (Sundaram, K.M, M.M. Shreehan, and E.F. Olszewski. 2001. Ethylene. In Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Online)).

Oxidizing Agents, Strong WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Alkynes, with Acetylenic Hydrogen:

   No evidence was found for a hazardous reaction between alcohols and alkynes at ambient conditions. At elevated temperatures and pressures, acetylene can react with alcohols at significantly elevated pressures to create vinyl compounds. For example, 2-methoxypropene was synthesized by the addition of methanol to propyne at temperatures above 120C (Agré, B. A. et al. (1983). Pharmaceutical Chemistry Journal 17 (3): 221).

Alcohols and Polyols WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated WITH Reducing Agents, Strong:

Reducing Agents, Strong WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Acids, Strong Oxidizing WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated:

   Phenylacetylene explodes on contact with perchloric acid. This can even occur at cryogenic temperatures if a dilutant is not present (Martheard, J.P. et al. 1982. Tetrahedron Letters 23:3484.). 

   Acetylene reacts violently or explosively with most oxidants (Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 265.).

   Cyclopentadiene reacts explosively with HNO3 or concentrated H2SO4 (Wilson, P.J. et al. 1944. Chemical Reviews 38:8.). 

   Aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbons are very susceptible to oxidation by strong oxidizing acids, which can result in heat generation and fire (Rich, G. A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 249).

   Addition of mineral acids to alkenes can result in exothermic alkene-addition reactions, forming alkyl sulfates in the case of sulfuric acid (Rich, G. A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 242). 

   Strong oxidizing acids, such as sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, or nitric acid, can catalyze exothermic alkene-hydration reactions, which produce alcohols (Loudon, Marc. 2002. Organic Chemistry. 4th ed. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 152).

   Strong oxidizing acids can initiate the exothermic polymerization of olefins. These reactions can be violent (Rich, G. A., 1993, Dangerous Chemical Reactions, Gulf Publishing Co., Houston, TX, p. 251).

   Acetylene and HNO3 react to liberate toxic NOx and inert CO2 gases (Copenhaver, J. W. and Bigelow M. H. Acetylene and Carbon Monoxide Chemistry. New York: Reinhold Publishing Co, 1949, pp. 23).

   Dienes and alkynes form hypergolic (spontaneously explosive) mixtures with HNO3 (Andrussow, L. 1961. Chim. Ind. (Paris) 86:542).

Acids, Strong Oxidizing WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Acids or acid fumes promote violent polymerization of acrolein (MCA Safety Datasheet 85, Manufacturing Chemists’ Association, Washington, 1961; Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 417; Lewis, R.J., Sr. 1992. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 8th Edition. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. pp. 63).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995.

Metals, Less Reactive WITH Hydrocarbons, Aliphatic Unsaturated:

   Acetylenic compounds with replaceable acetylenically bound hydrogen atoms must be kept out of contact with copper, silver, mercury, or alloys containing them, to avoid formation of explosive metal acetylides (“Chemical Intermediates”, 1972 Catalogue, 158, Tamaqua (Pa.), Air Products and Chemicals Inc., 1972; Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages (Section 1, ‘Inflammable Liquids’), London, HMSO, 1972, p. 27; Urben, P.G. 1995. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards, 5th Edition. Volume 2. Oxford: Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 5-6, 192).

   Acetylene reacts with copper to form explosive acetylides (Association of British Chemical Manufacturers. 1946. Quarterly Safety Summary 17, 24).

   Copper, mercury, or silver, can form explosive acetylides in contact with 3-bromopropyne (Dangerous Substances: Guidance on Fires and Spillages (Section 1, ‘Inflammable Liquids’), London, HMSO, 1972, p. 27).

Metals, Less Reactive WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   All of the noble metals are catalytically active and react with monomer-type small molecules. In particular, ruthenium and rhodium are alkene oligomerization catalysts, and palladium is used as an alkene polymerization catalyst (Behr, A. 2010. Catalysis, Homogeneous. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Oxidizing Agents, Strong WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:

   CHROMIUM OXYCHLORIDE fumes in moist air.  The compound hydrolyzes exothermically on contact with water to generate chromic acid, hydrochloric acid and some chlorine (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room conditions, about 9 percent of the theoretical yield of HCl evolved as a gas in the first 45 minutes (Brown, D. F., et al. (2005) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2004 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-05-2, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL). 

   Water vapor will combust with fluorine; an explosive reaction occurs between liquid fluorine and ice, after an intermediate induction period (T. Harper, H. W. Schmidt, “Handling and Use of Fluorine and Fluorine-Oxygen Mixtures in Rocket Systems”, NASA Special Publication SP-3037: 52 (1967)).

   If liquid air which has stood for some time and contains condensed water from the atmosphere is treated with fluorine, a precipitate is formed which is likely to explode. The explosive material is thought to be fluorine hydrate (Mellor, J.W. 1940. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, p. 11. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

   TRICHLORO-S-TRIAZINETRIONE may react with water releasing gaseous chlorine. If mixed with a small amount of water, the concentrated solution (with pH at about 2.0) may explode due to the evolution of unstable nitrogen trichloride (Bretherick, L. 1996. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards. Vol. 1, p 384. Fifth Ed. Urben, P.G., Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA).

   NITRIC OXIDE combines very rapidly with oxygen in the air to form nitrogen dioxide. NITROGEN DIOXIDE reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide. The liquid nitrogen oxide is very sensitive to detonation, in the presence of water (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). 

  CALCIUM HYPOCHLORITE is slowly decomposed by water with the evolution of gaseous chlorine and heat. Experimental work at Argonne National Laboratory has determined that there is essentially no Cl2 gas formation; the substance is quite unreactive in water. This does not prevent Cl2 formation by a catalytic mechanism, but under normal conditions calcium hypochlorite is quite unreactive. The hydration reaction was rapid and quite exothermic. The small change in gas volume was attributed to this heating. (Argonne Report ANL/DIS-00-1, October 2000).

  CYANURIC CHLORIDE reacts exothermically with water, especially if catalyzed or heated, to generate fumes of hydrochloric acid.

  DICHLOROISOCYANURIC ACID, DRY may vigorously react with small quantities of water releasing chlorine gas.

  Water vapor will react combustibly with Fluorine; an explosive reaction occurs between liquid fluorine and ice, after an intermediate induction period, [NASA SP-3037: 52(1967)]: If liquid air, which has stood for some time is treated with Fluorine, a precipitate is formed which is likely to explode. Explosive material is thought to be Fluorine Hydrate, [Mellor 2:11(1946-1947)].

  LITHIUM HYPOCHLORITE is soluble in water and decomposes slowly in water with the evolution of chlorine gas.

  (MONO)-(TRICHLORO)-TETRA-(MONOPOTASSIUM DICHLORO)-PENTA-S-TRIAZINETRIONE is soluble in water.  It may vigorously react with water releasing chlorine gas.

  Material containing less than 39% available chlorine will undergo reactions as described herein, but may take longer to initiate, and the resulting reaction may not be as vigorous [AAR 1992].

  NITRIC OXIDE combines very rapidly with oxygen in the air to form nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide, reacts with alkalis to form nitrates and nitrites [Merck 11th ed. 1989].

  NITROGEN DIOXIDE reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide, it reacts with alkalis to form nitrate and nitrites [Merck 11th ed. 1989]. The liquid nitrogen oxide is very sensitive to detonation, in the presence of water.

  NITROGEN TETROXIDE reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide.

  SODIUM DICHLORO-S-TRIAZINETRIONE may vigorously react with water releasing chlorine gas.  Material containing less than 39% available chlorine will undergo reactions as described herein, but may take longer to initiate, and the resulting reaction may not be as vigorous [AAR 1992].

  SODIUM PERBORATE, in the presence of moist air or water, rapidly evolves oxygen, especially in the presence of base. This presents a severe fire/explosion risk in enhancing combustion process.

  SODIUM SUPEROXIDE reacts with moisture and carbon dioxide in the air. The compound reacts vigorously with water to give oxygen and sodium hydroxide.

  TRICHLORO-S-TRIAZINETRIONE may react with water releasing gaseous chlorine. If mixed with a small amount of water, the concentrated solution (with pH at about 2.0) may explode due to the evolution of unstable nitrogen trichloride. (Bretherick 5th ed.).

Halogenating Agents WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:

   ANTIMONY PENTAFLUORIDE gives off hydrogen fluoride fumes on contact with air (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989).

   Bromine pentafluoride produces corrosive fumes in moist air (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989).  The compound reacts explosively upon contact with water, evolving oxygen gas, which can result in a fire (Mellor, J.W. 1956. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, Supp. 1, p. 172. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd).

   Chlorine pentafluoride reacts with water or moisture in the air to produce corrosive hydrofluoric acid and toxic chloride gas (Pilipovich, D. et al., Inorg. Chem., 1967, 6, p. 1918). Interaction with ice at -100 C, or with water vapor above 0 C is vigorous (Christe, K.O. Inorg. Chem. 1972, 11, 1220).

   Chlorine trifluoride violently reacts with water or ice to generate hydrogen fluoride (HF) and chlorine (Cl2)( The Chemical Elements and their Compounds, Sidgwick, N.V., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1950 p. 1156). The release of chlorine trifluoride to the atmosphere rapidly generates two toxic reaction products: HF and chlorine dioxide (Lombardi, D.A. and M.D. Cheng,  1996. ""Modeling Accidental Releases of Chlorine Trifluoride to the Atmosphere,"" Paper No. 96-WP66B.02, presented at the 89th Annual Meeting of the Air and Waste Management Association, Nashville, Tennessee, June 23-26).

   OXYGEN DIFLUORIDE violently exploded when a spark was discharged in a 25-70%  mixture of oxygen difluoride with oxygen over water (Mellor, J.W. 1956. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, Supp. 1, p. 191. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

   PHOSPHORUS PENTABROMIDE fumes in air. This compound decomposes in water or moist air to form corrosive hydrogen bromide fumes (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room conditions, about 35 percent of the theoretical yield of HBr evolved as a gas in the first minute (Brown, D.

Experimental work at Argonne National Laboratory has determined that there is essentially no Cl2 gas formation; the substance is quite unreactive in water. This does not prevent Cl2 formation by a catalytic mechanism, but under normal conditions calcium hypochlorite is quite unreactive. The hydration reaction was rapid and quite exothermic. The small change in gas volume was attributed to this heating. (Argonne Report ANL/DIS-00-1, October 2000).

   Chlorine trifluoride violently reacts with water or ice to generate hydrogen fluoride (HF) and chlorine (Cl2)( The Chemical Elements and their Compounds, Sidgwick, N.V., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1950 p. 1156).

Polymerizable Compounds WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:

   If phase separation occurs in water, the inhibitor in the polymerizable material may migrate to the aqueous phase, destabilizing the polymerizable material (Predicted).

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

Metals, Elemental and Powder, Active WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:

   BARIUM reacts with moisture in the air. It rapidly reacts with water to generate gaseous hydrogen. The heat of reaction is sufficient that the evolved hydrogen may ignite (Lab. Govt. Chemist 1965). The element is pyrophoric in powdered form. The interaction of barium with water is more violent than the interaction of calcium or strontium with water, but less violent than sodium (Bretherick, L. 1996. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards. Vol. 1, p 88-89. Fifth Ed. Urben, P.G., Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA).

   ZINC DUST can evolve gaseous hydrogen in contact with water or damp air. The heat of the reaction may be sufficient to ignite the hydrogen produced (Hazardous Chemical Reactions, NFPA 491, Boston, National Fire Protection Association, 1966, p. 171)."

Acids, Strong Oxidizing WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:

   Heat is generated when strong acids are dissolved in water (“heat of solution""). The heat may be sufficient to generate fumes of the acid.

   The reaction of sulfuric acid with water is negligible unless acid strength is above 80-90% then heat from hydrolysis is extreme, may cause severe burns (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). During sulfonation of mononitrobenzene by fuming sulfuric acid, a leak from an internal cooling coil permitted water to enter the reaction tank. A violent eruption occurred due to the heat of solution (MCA Case History 944, Case Histories of Accidents in the Chemical Industry, Washington, Manufacturing Chemists’ Association, 1963).

   Nitrosylsulfuric acid decomposes in water to form sulfuric and nitric acids, as well as gaseous NO2 (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room conditions, about 94 percent of the theoretical yield of NO2 evolved as a gas in the first 5 minutes (Brown, D. F., et al. (2000) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2000 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-00-1, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL). 

   Sulfur trioxide fumes heavily in moist air. The fumes are acidic and corrosive. Combines violently with water, forming sulfuric acid (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989).

   Fluorosulfonic acid fumes in moist air, and reacts violently with water to form hydrogen fluoride and sulfuric acid mist and large amounts of heat (Tabel, E., Zirngiebl, E. and Maas, J. 2011. Fluorosulfuric Acid. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. (Online)).

   Nitric acid is soluble in all proportions with water. Dissolution in water produces heat, fumes (including acid fumes), and spattering (Thiemann, M., Scheibler, E. and Wiegand, K. W. 2000.

The compound hydrolyzes exothermically on contact with water to generate chromic acid, hydrochloric acid and some chlorine (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room conditions, about 9 percent of the theoretical yield of HCl evolved as a gas in the first 45 minutes (Brown, D. F., et al. (2005) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2004 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-05-2, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL). 

   Water vapor will combust with fluorine; an explosive reaction occurs between liquid fluorine and ice, after an intermediate induction period (T. Harper, H. W. Schmidt, “Handling and Use of Fluorine and Fluorine-Oxygen Mixtures in Rocket Systems”, NASA Special Publication SP-3037: 52 (1967)).

   If liquid air which has stood for some time and contains condensed water from the atmosphere is treated with fluorine, a precipitate is formed which is likely to explode. The explosive material is thought to be fluorine hydrate (Mellor, J.W. 1940. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 2, p. 11. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

   TRICHLORO-S-TRIAZINETRIONE may react with water releasing gaseous chlorine. If mixed with a small amount of water, the concentrated solution (with pH at about 2.0) may explode due to the evolution of unstable nitrogen trichloride (Bretherick, L. 1996. Bretherick’s Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards. Vol. 1, p 384. Fifth Ed. Urben, P.G., Ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, MA).

   NITRIC OXIDE combines very rapidly with oxygen in the air to form nitrogen dioxide. NITROGEN DIOXIDE reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide. The liquid nitrogen oxide is very sensitive to detonation, in the presence of water (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). 

  CALCIUM HYPOCHLORITE is slowly decomposed by water with the evolution of gaseous chlorine and heat. Experimental work at Argonne National Laboratory has determined that there is essentially no Cl2 gas formation; the substance is quite unreactive in water. This does not prevent Cl2 formation by a catalytic mechanism, but under normal conditions calcium hypochlorite is quite unreactive. The hydration reaction was rapid and quite exothermic. The small change in gas volume was attributed to this heating. (Argonne Report ANL/DIS-00-1, October 2000).

  CYANURIC CHLORIDE reacts exothermically with water, especially if catalyzed or heated, to generate fumes of hydrochloric acid.

  DICHLOROISOCYANURIC ACID, DRY may vigorously react with small quantities of water releasing chlorine gas.

  Water vapor will react combustibly with Fluorine; an explosive reaction occurs between liquid fluorine and ice, after an intermediate induction period, [NASA SP-3037: 52(1967)]: If liquid air, which has stood for some time is treated with Fluorine, a precipitate is formed which is likely to explode. Explosive material is thought to be Fluorine Hydrate, [Mellor 2:11(1946-1947)].

  LITHIUM HYPOCHLORITE is soluble in water and decomposes slowly in water with the evolution of chlorine gas.

  (MONO)-(TRICHLORO)-TETRA-(MONOPOTASSIUM DICHLORO)-PENTA-S-TRIAZINETRIONE is soluble in water.  It may vigorously react with water releasing chlorine gas.

  Material containing less than 39% available chlorine will undergo reactions as described herein, but may take longer to initiate, and the resulting reaction may not be as vigorous [AAR 1992].

  NITRIC OXIDE combines very rapidly with oxygen in the air to form nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide, reacts with alkalis to form nitrates and nitrites [Merck 11th ed. 1989].

  NITROGEN DIOXIDE reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide, it reacts with alkalis to form nitrate and nitrites [Merck 11th ed. 1989]. The liquid nitrogen oxide is very sensitive to detonation, in the presence of water.

  NITROGEN TETROXIDE reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide.

  SODIUM PERBORATE, in the presence of moist air or water, rapidly evolves oxygen, especially in the presence of base. This presents a severe fire/explosion risk in enhancing combustion process.

  SODIUM SUPEROXIDE reacts with moisture and carbon dioxide in the air. The compound reacts vigorously with water to give oxygen and sodium hydroxide.

  TRICHLORO-S-TRIAZINETRIONE may react with water releasing gaseous chlorine. If mixed with a small amount of water, the concentrated solution (with pH at about 2.0) may explode due to the evolution of unstable nitrogen trichloride. (Bretherick 5th ed.)."

   PHOSPHORUS OXYBROMIDE reacts slowly and exothermically with water to form phosphoric acid and hydrobromic acid (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). Decomposes exothermically in water to form toxic fumes of hydrobromic and phosphoric acids (Lewis, R.J., Sr. 2000. Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, 10th Edition. New York: John Wiley & Sons, pp. 2957). In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room temperature and pressure, about 12 percent of the theoretical yield of HBr evolved as a gas in the first 30 minutes. This rate of gas production was slow enough that essentially all of the gas dissolved in the water as it was released, generating an aqueous hydrobromic acid solution instead of gaseous hydrogen bromide (Brown, D. F., et al. (2005) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2004 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-05-2, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL).

   PHOSPHORUS OXYCHLORIDE fumes in air.  The compound reacts exothermically with water to form fumes of phosphoric acid and hydrogen chloride. In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room temperature and pressure, about 21 percent of the theoretical yield of HCl evolved as a gas in the first 20 minutes (Brown, D.

   Chlorosulfonic acid reacts exothermically and violently with water producing sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and large quantities of dense white acid fumes. Contact with water and metal produces explosive hydrogen gas (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989; U.S. Coast Guard. 1999.

Reducing Agents, Weak WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:

   No evidence was found for a hazardous reaction between these reactive groups under most conditions. Because of the nature of the members of the Weak Reducing Agents group we would not expect reaction kinetics to yield hazardous conditions. We urge chemists to perform testing to ensure that hazards do not occur under conditions appropriate to the scenario.

   However, evidence of a potentially hazardous reaction under unusual conditions was found: 
   With water, sodium hydrosulfite slowly oxidizes to sodium bisulfite and later to sulfur dioxide and sodium hydroxide with evolution of heat.  The chemical may ignite combustible materials in contact with moisture or air.  Moist sodium hydrosulfite is likely to ignite upon drying (Hazardous Chemical Reactions, NFPA 491M, Quincy (MA), National Fire Protection Association, 10th ed., 1991). This compound is soluble in water and would dissolve smoothly with no evolution of gases in most spills. However, large spills into small amounts of water could cause heating due to heat of dissolution, possibly resulting in decomposition and evolution of SO2 gas and possibly H2S gas (Brown, D. F., et al. (2000) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2000 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-00-1, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL).

Experimental work at Argonne National Laboratory has determined that there is essentially no Cl2 gas formation; the substance is quite unreactive in water. This does not prevent Cl2 formation by a catalytic mechanism, but under normal conditions calcium hypochlorite is quite unreactive. The hydration reaction was rapid and quite exothermic. The small change in gas volume was attributed to this heating. (Argonne Report ANL/DIS-00-1, October 2000).

  CYANURIC CHLORIDE reacts exothermically with water, especially if catalyzed or heated, to generate fumes of hydrochloric acid.

  DICHLOROISOCYANURIC ACID, DRY may vigorously react with small quantities of water releasing chlorine gas.

  Water vapor will react combustibly with Fluorine; an explosive reaction occurs between liquid fluorine and ice, after an intermediate induction period, [NASA SP-3037: 52(1967)]: If liquid air, which has stood for some time is treated with Fluorine, a precipitate is formed which is likely to explode. Explosive material is thought to be Fluorine Hydrate, [Mellor 2:11(1946-1947)].

  LITHIUM HYPOCHLORITE is soluble in water and decomposes slowly in water with the evolution of chlorine gas.

  (MONO)-(TRICHLORO)-TETRA-(MONOPOTASSIUM DICHLORO)-PENTA-S-TRIAZINETRIONE is soluble in water.  It may vigorously react with water releasing chlorine gas.

  Material containing less than 39% available chlorine will undergo reactions as described herein, but may take longer to initiate, and the resulting reaction may not be as vigorous [AAR 1992].

  NITRIC OXIDE combines very rapidly with oxygen in the air to form nitrogen dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide, reacts with alkalis to form nitrates and nitrites [Merck 11th ed. 1989].

  NITROGEN DIOXIDE reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide, it reacts with alkalis to form nitrate and nitrites [Merck 11th ed. 1989]. The liquid nitrogen oxide is very sensitive to detonation, in the presence of water.

  NITROGEN TETROXIDE reacts with water to form nitric acid and nitric oxide.

  SODIUM PERBORATE, in the presence of moist air or water, rapidly evolves oxygen, especially in the presence of base. This presents a severe fire/explosion risk in enhancing combustion process.

  SODIUM SUPEROXIDE reacts with moisture and carbon dioxide in the air. The compound reacts vigorously with water to give oxygen and sodium hydroxide.

  TRICHLORO-S-TRIAZINETRIONE may react with water releasing gaseous chlorine. If mixed with a small amount of water, the concentrated solution (with pH at about 2.0) may explode due to the evolution of unstable nitrogen trichloride. (Bretherick 5th ed.)."

Reducing Agents, Strong WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:

   ANTIMONY PENTACHLORIDE, LIQUID fumes in air to form hydrochloric acid. The compound reacts with water to yield heat and antimony pentaoxide (Sb2O5) and hydrochloric acid (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989).

   CHROMOUS CHLORIDE is stable in dry air, but oxidizes rapidly in moist air or standing water with liberation of hydrogen (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989).

   When exposed to air, white phosphorus emits a green light and gives off white fumes. It ignites at 30 C in moist air; higher temperatures are required for ignition in dry air (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989).

   PHOSPHORUS TRICHLORIDE fumes in air.  The chemical reacts violently with water, generating dense hydrogen chloride vapors.  In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room conditions, the maximum theoretical yield of HCl gas was generated within 10 minutes (Brown, D. F., et al. (2000) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2000 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-00-1, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL).

   PHOSPHORUS TRIBROMIDE fumes in air. The chemical is decomposed by water to form phosphoric acid and hydrobromic acid. Reaction with warm water is very rapid and may be violent (Mellor, J.W. 1940. Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry. Vol. 8, p. 1032. Longmans, Green and Co Ltd.).

   With water, sodium hydrosulfite slowly oxidizes to sodium bisulfite and later to sulfur dioxide and sodium hydroxide with evolution of heat.  The chemical may ignite combustible materials in contact with moisture or air.  Moist sodium hydrosulfite is likely to ignite upon drying (Hazardous Chemical Reactions, NFPA 491M, Quincy (MA), National Fire Protection Association, 10th ed., 1991). This compound is soluble in water and would dissolve smoothly with no evolution of gases in most spills. However, large spills into small amounts of water could cause heating due to heat of dissolution, possibly resulting in decomposition and evolution of SO2 gas and possibly H2S gas (Brown, D. F., et al. (2000) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2000 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-00-1, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL). "

Acids, Strong Oxidizing WITH Water and Aqueous Solutions:

   Heat is generated when strong acids are dissolved in water (“heat of solution""). The heat may be sufficient to generate fumes of the acid.

   The reaction of sulfuric acid with water is negligible unless acid strength is above 80-90% then heat from hydrolysis is extreme, may cause severe burns (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). During sulfonation of mononitrobenzene by fuming sulfuric acid, a leak from an internal cooling coil permitted water to enter the reaction tank. A violent eruption occurred due to the heat of solution (MCA Case History 944, Case Histories of Accidents in the Chemical Industry, Washington, Manufacturing Chemists’ Association, 1963).

   Nitrosylsulfuric acid decomposes in water to form sulfuric and nitric acids, as well as gaseous NO2 (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989). In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room conditions, about 94 percent of the theoretical yield of NO2 evolved as a gas in the first 5 minutes (Brown, D. F., et al. (2000) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2000 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-00-1, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL). 

   Sulfur trioxide fumes heavily in moist air. The fumes are acidic and corrosive. Combines violently with water, forming sulfuric acid (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 11th ed. 1989).

Salts, Acidic WITH Polymerizable Compounds:

   Polymerizable:  Materials, commonly called monomers, that have the capability to undergo thermally induced or chemically initiated radical type polymerization reactions, which could generate significant amounts of heat (up to -100 kJ/mol) and pressure due to decomposition and formation of gas byproducts.  These monomers are mainly the vinyl monomers common to the chemical industry such as styrene and its derivatives (including divinyl benzene), acrylamide and its derivatives, butadiene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and others.  Also included here are the acrylates and acrylic acid derivatives but note that these materials are also captured in this tool in a separate and distinct category due to their unique hazards and their high volume of use in the industry.

   These materials typically are inhibited with low ppm levels of antioxidants (inhibitors) to prevent premature polymerization chain reactions.  Many of these inhibitors require dissolved oxygen to be effective.  Inhibitor depletion is a function of time and temperature, with higher temperatures increasing depletion rates.  These materials are known to be susceptible to destabilization due to low ppm levels of contaminants.  Radical generating contaminants such as peroxides and azides are known to initiate monomer polymerization; however, the effects of seemingly benign materials are harder to predict.  Therefore, extreme caution should be used in any contamination event. And the material should be presumed to be destabilized until testing and consultation with experts.  Uncontrolled polymerization reactions can become adiabatic and lead to a serious runaway reaction with high temperatures and pressures.  The general hazards of monomers are discussed in Frurip et al., Process Safety Progress (Vol. 14, No. 2) 1995."

   ALUMINUM BROMIDE is deliquescent and fumes in moist air. The reaction with water is vigorous and exothermic and can destroy containers if water is added directly (Nicholson, D.G. et al. Inorg. Synth. 3, 35 1950). Experimental work at Argonne National Laboratory has determined that the expected production of HBr gas by hydrolysis of AlBr3 is actually quite slow; no gas was produced within the first 20 minutes of the experiment. This finding does not preclude the possibility of formation of HBr by a catalytic mechanism, but HBr production by direct hydrolysis was not observed in this experiment. However, formation of a hydrated AlBr3 complex was observed and it was a rapid and exothermic process. The heat evolved in this reaction could result in the production of acidic mists if a large quantity of aluminum bromide is spilled into a small quantity of water (Brown, D. F., et al. (2000) Development of the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances for the 2000 Emergency Response Guidebook, ANL/DIS-00-1, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne IL).

   TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE reacts exothermically with moisture in the air to evolve dense white fumes containing hydrochloric acid (The Merck Index, Rahway (NJ), Merck and Co. Inc., 13th ed. 1996). Titanium tetrachloride reacts vigorously with water to generate gaseous HCl.  In experiments at Argonne National Laboratory, in which it was mixed with water and stirred at room conditions, about 27 percent of the theoretical yield of HCl evolved as a gas within the first 5 minutes (Brown, D.
