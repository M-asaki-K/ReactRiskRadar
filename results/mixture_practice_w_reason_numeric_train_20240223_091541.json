The concentration threshold for 2,4,6-tribromophenol in the air is very low, with neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects observed even at levels as low as 1 ppm. Environmental factors such as temperature and pressure can exacerbate the risks, as higher temperatures can accelerate the reaction rate and increase the release of toxic gases.

Silane, a highly reactive compound, undergoes a hydrolysis reaction when in contact with water to produce silanol and hydrogen gas. However, in the presence of polyethylene AS, a relatively inert and non-polar plastic, the hydrolysis reaction of silane is significantly inhibited. The hydrophobic nature of polyethylene AS restricts water access to silane, reducing the rate of hydrolysis and subsequent hydrogen gas evolution. As a result, the potential for gas evolution and pressure build-up, which may occur in the absence of a compatible material like polyethylene AS, is greatly diminished. Additionally, the concentration of silane is within safe limits for the intended application, further reducing the overall hazard score.
